# Three.js starter 

This is a very basic `Three.js` project with a simple scene to start working from.

Clone the repo & run the following to get started.

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
yarn install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
yarn dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
yarn build
```
